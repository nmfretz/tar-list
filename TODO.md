# MISC TODOS

-go through html/css/javascript and clean up attribute names.
-use spread operator to change nodelists into arrays. do this instead of Array.from(nodelist)
-check newVehicle spread operator to clone object. may not need this anymore
-check to see if maps and sets can be used.
-consider using a generator for IDs
-break out functions into a separate .js file...

Design considerations
-search-text size?
-use higher quality driver photos
-overlay colour
-change headlight toggle to something simple?
-add enter event listener on 2nd and 3rd modals or else remove on first for consistency

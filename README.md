# Car List App

My first app! üê±‚Äçüíª

This is an app I developed while learning html/css/javascript/node. My twin toddlers are obsessed with vehicles, so I developed an app for us to store their favourites.

Some of the functionality may seem silly; however, these aspects were included based on funny interactions with my kids. For example, I added the ability to change the colour of the red car's headlights after my kids started yelling out different colors the first time they saw the headlights turn on (they had just learned how to say a few colours!).

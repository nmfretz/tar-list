# Car List App

My first app! 🐱‍💻

This is a simple web app I developed while learning html/css/javascript/node. My twin toddlers love all manner of vehicles, and so I build them an app to store their favourites.

Some of the functionality may seem silly; however, these aspects were included based on funny interactions with my kids (e.g., being able to turn on and off the headlights of the header image).
